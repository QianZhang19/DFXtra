# Grad Profile System

The Grad Profile System is a full-stack web application designed to manage and display profiles of graduates. This project utilises a React frontend for the user interface and an Express.js backend to handle data retrieval and storage.


## Features

* Profile Display: View detailed profiles of graduates including their personal information, educational background, work experiences, certifications, achievements, and portfolio items.
* Dynamic Content: Profiles are dynamically generated based on data stored in the backend, allowing for easy addition, modification, and deletion of profiles.
* Mock Data: Includes mock data for testing and demonstration purposes. You can easily replace this data with real user profiles.
* Responsive Design: The frontend is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.
* Error Handling: Includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors during data retrieval or user interactions.
* Environment Variables: Utilizes environment variables for configuration, allowing for easy customization of backend endpoints and other settings.
* RESTful API: The backend provides a RESTful API for fetching profile data, enabling integration with other systems or third-party applications.

## Technologies Used

* Frontend:
  * React.js
  * Axios for HTTP requests
  * Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling
* Backend:
  * Node.js with Express.js
  * MongoDB or another database for storing profile data
* DevOps:
  * Git for version control
  * Docker for containerization (optional)
  * Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools for automated testing and deployment (optional)
